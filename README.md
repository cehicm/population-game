# population-game
This project uses vanilla Javascript to show random countries, and allow users to submit their guesses for the population of the chosen country. 

The idea to create this project sponteneously came about one night, while we were trying to think of a fun thing we could do without even getting up. Hopefully, this game will bring family game night to the next level for others too.
